# Contributing to the Elmah.io package

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Elmah.io package.

We are building this software together and strongly encourage contributions from the community that are within the guidelines set forth
below.

## Bug Fixes and New Features

Before starting to write code, look for existing [issues](https://github.com/jimiit92/elmah.io-go/issues) or
[create one](https://github.com/jimiit92/elmah.io-go/issues/new) for your bug, issue, or feature request. This helps the community
avoid working on something that might not be of interest or which has already been addressed.

## Pull Requests & Patches

Patches should generally be made against the master (default) branch and include relevant tests, if applicable.

Code should compile and tests should pass under all go versions which the driver currently supports.  Currently the driver
supports a minimum version of go 1.10.

If you are working on a bug or feature listed in the Issues tab, please include the issue id prefixed with ELMAHIO in the commit,
e.g. ELMAHIO-123. For the patch commit message itself, please follow the [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) guide.

## Talk To Us

If you want to work on the package, write documentation, or have questions/complaints, please reach out to use either via
PM or by creating a Question issue at (https://github.com/jimiit92/elmah.io-go/issues/new).
